**Environmental Monitoring Toolkit for HARDWARIO Bridge Module**

This project is a Python CLI tool providing access to HARDWARIO Bridge Module - an USB to I2C adapter. In connection with HARDWARIO Climate Module, this tool can provide useful environmental data - temperature, relative air humidity, atmospheric pressure, altitude above the sea level, and illuminance. The data can be output to console stdout or published via MQTT message in JSON format.


## Requirements

* macOS or Linux machine (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
* MicroUSB cable
* HARDWARIO Bridge Module
* HARDWARIO Climate Module


## Installation on Raspberry Pi

1. Install the build tools:

    sudo apt install -y autotools-dev autoconf automake libtool

1. Install the library dependencies:

    sudo apt install -y libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev

1. Downloaded the sources:

    $ wget https://github.com/libusb/hidapi/archive/hidapi-0.9.0.tar.gz

1. Extract the downloaded sources:

    $ tar xzf hidapi-0.9.0.tar.gz

1. Go to the sources directory:

    $ cd hidapi-hidapi-0.9.0
