**Environmental Monitoring Toolkit for HARDWARIO Bridge Module**

This project is a Python CLI tool providing access to HARDWARIO Bridge Module - an USB to I2C adapter. In connection with HARDWARIO Climate Module, this tool can provide useful environmental data - temperature, relative air humidity, atmospheric pressure, altitude above the sea level, and illuminance. The data can be output to console stdout or published via MQTT message in JSON format.
